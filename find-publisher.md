# Finding your Windows Publisher info

In order to publish your PWA in the Microsoft Store, you'll need 3 things:

1. `Package ID`
2. `Publisher ID`
3. `Publisher display name`

To get this information, go to [Windows Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard) and click on your app. (Don't have an app yet? [Create one](/publish-new-app.md).)

Choose `Product Management` -> `Product Identity`:

You'll see the Package ID, Publisher ID, and publisher display name. You'll need all three of these to publish in the Store.

On PWABuilder when generating your Windows app, add these values to the Windows package options:
